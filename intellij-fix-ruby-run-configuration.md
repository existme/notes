# Intellij - fix Ruby run configuration

To be able to run Ruby files from intelliJ, make sure that first both these folders are writable?

``` sh
s chmod -R a+rw /var/lib/gems/2.5.0 

# **Maybe** this is also required, maybe!
s chmod -R a+rw /usr/local/lib/site_ruby/2.5.0 
```

You might also need to uninstall `debase-0.2.3.beta2` and installing `debase-0.2.2` by running the following command: (ref [Issue #64 Â· denofevil/debase][IIDNFI6DDG])
``` sh
gem uninstall --user-install debase
```
