# Mafia
![image.png](/img/games/godfather.png)
Mafia is a party game of bluffing and suspicion. It is designed for seven to seventeen players, in Mafia some players take on the roles of Mafia members, others become the civilians of a crime-filled community.
Every night the Mafia kills another person, every day the civilians have a chance to discuss the murder, choose suspects, and condemn one of them to death. Since every role is secret, you never know who is an innocent bystander, and who is part of the Mafia. If the Mafia kill off enough civilians, the community becomes a permanent haven for crime, but if the civilians rid their community of the Mafia, they win.

## THE OBJECTIVE
Simply put, the objective of the game is for the mafia to “kill off” citizens until they are the majority or the civilians to kill off the entire mafia. When one of those two things happens, the game is over.

For the sake of example, let’s say you have a group of 13 people. Roles must be assigned to each person in secret. There will be 3 mafias (1 Mafia Don,1 terror, 1 simple mafia), and the civilian team 1 detective, 1 doctor, 1 sniper, 1 Armor, and 6 simple citizens. Great, now everyone has a role. 

Be sure they are all kept under wraps. Do not tell anyone your identity. The game itself is divided into two phases: Day and Night. During the night, everyone keeps his or her eyes (webcams) closed until the narrator talks to each role beginning with the mafia, then the doctor, then the detective. 

Here is a quick tutorial about the game: [How to play mafia: animated - YouTube][HTPMAY]

### Day time
During the day, god can give each person 2 minutes ( more/less ) to talk. He/she can also allow a second row of talks depending to the situation.
After the god says it's time! each player requests for talk by typing a word that god says in the Mafia chat and based on the order of the requests god allows the person to talk.

### Voting
After the discussion is over god can allow defend/lobby/challenges.
Then the voting should start and players should announce in the chat at the same time who they have identified as Mafia which should be kicked of from the game.
If a player gains more than the half of the votes, he/she would immidiately be sent to defend otherwise another voting will happen and all players can only vote to those who had the most votes. If there is no conclusion on voting no one will be kicked off. 

For example, if during the day players concluded that it might be better to not send any one out they all can vote to themselvs.

It's important to keep track of who votes to whom since that can reveal who are the mafias and how they are forming the public opinion.

If a player is kicked out of the game. The god of the game will anonce his/her role. If the the role was Mafia-Terror, he can kill one other player before dying (that's why it's better no to vote on Terror and instead let sniper kills him)

### Defends, Lobbies, Challenges
The god of the game can allow certain number of Lobbies and challenges after the discussions are over. Here are the differences between them:

**Lobbies:**: when a player wins to have a lobby, he/she can ask for two or three players to accompany him in the lobby. The purpose here is to form an alignment or discuss with those who seem to have more knowledge about the game. Another purpose is to form the public opinion on who they should vote. Lobby time is around 2-3 minutes.

**Challenges**: when a player wins to have a challenge, he/she can ask another player to come up for a hot debate. The main purpose of the challenge is to press the counter part to reveal his/her identity or prove her inocense. The challenge time is also between 2-3 minutes.

**Defends**: In defend a person can defend his/innocense. In this phase she cannot name any other player but she can point to some fact. Any mention of other players will result in cutting her off/banning her. Defend is always given to the one who is condemned by the voting process but god can announce a round of defend to players to give them a chance of defending even before the voting has started.


## Rules
In general, you can lie and say pretty much whatever you want during a game of Mafia. However, there are some ground rules:

1. The roles are randomly assigned by god with going to [Mafia Forum Administration - Nerd Network][MFANN]
   Here are all the roles to be copy&pasted there
   ```
   Mafia - Don
   Mafia - Simple Mafia
   Mafia - Terror
   Civilian - Doctor
   Civilian - Detective
   Civilian - Sniper
   Civilian - Armor
   Civilian - Simple Citizen
   ```   
   We have 7 effective roles and depending on the number of players we have the number of Simple Citizens (ex: with 13 ppl we should have 6 (13-7) simple citizens)
1. No one is allowed to talk more than the time which is dedicated to him/her and god shall be able to mute people
2. During the night and after voting is done, all those player who have an effective role should tell god about their decision in a private chat. For example Mafia team announces who should be killed, the doctor says who should be healed and etc.
3. The order that players take the seat and are allowed to talk/defend is decided by god!
4. Opening your eyes(/turning your webcam on) when it is not permitted is cheating.
5. Texting other players in private/public chat is cheating. Only the Mafia team can chat privately together.
## Roles:
1. **God of the game**: (/the Story Teller/the mayor/Judge/narrator)
   Is the moderator of the whole game play and anonunces turns and keeps the time rolling. He/she knows everybody's rules and has the right to silence the group or restart the game completely. The god doesnot not officially participate in the game.
1. **Mafia Team**:
   The Mafia-Team kill other players and try to convince other players who the mafia is without revealing themselves.
   1. **The Mafia Don**: (/the godfather)
      The god father is the most powerful mafia, he decides who should be killed during the night by consulting other mafias. If detective queries his status from God the answer is always NO. So Don is protected from being revealed to the detective.
   3. **The Terror**: If citizens vote to eleminate the terror during the day. The terror can take one of the players with himslef out of the game and the player will be assumed dead. However if the sniper kills terror during the night he will be elemniated without being able to kill other citizen.
   4. **The Simple Mafia**: Is part of the mafia team but doesn't have any special ability.
1. **Citizen Team**:
   1. **The Doctor**: (/Medic/Bodyguard)
      Doctor can save himself (look under "Circumstances") and can save others. One of the roles that doctor should try to save is the Detective. Since he is the one which might announce his role early in the game and once revealed it's important to save him.
   2. **The Sniper**: 
      Depending on the number of bullets that god has given to him, the sniper can kill someone during the night. It's possible to not kill anyone during night if the sniper is unsure of who is the Mafia. One of the best targets to be eleminated by sniper is the Terror from the Mafia team.
   4. **The Detective**:  (/sheriff)
      Points at any other player and the StoryTeller can either nod or shake his head if the person is mafia or not; uses his or her power to sway public opinion.
      **Important:** The query of Mafia's Don is always negative so a negative result of player not necessary means that he is not part of the Mafia group.
   1. **The Armor**:  (/Bulletproof)
      This player cannot be killed by Mafia and only be voted off. The imporance of this role is since it cannot be killed by Mafia, it can be claimed by the owner and might be helpful in guiding citizens to find the Mafia team.
   5. **Simple Citizen**: (/Civilian)
      Citizens are the most basic role, who votes and tries to figure out the mafias and vote them off

**IMPORTANT**: In real life, the dead can not speak. Common saying of course. So in the game, the dead are not allowed to influence the town through speech or physical gestures. It is cheating. (They can talk, but any hinting at a mafia should get them kicked from the next round or game.)
