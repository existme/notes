# Mafia
![image.png](/img/games/godfather.png)
Mafia is a party game of bluffing and suspicion. It is designed for seven to seventeen players, in Mafia some players take on the roles of Mafia members, others become the civilians of a crime-filled community.
Every night the Mafia kills another person, every day the civilians have a chance to discuss the murder, choose suspects, and condemn one of them to death. Since every role is secret, you never know who is an innocent bystander, and who is part of the Mafia. If the Mafia kill off enough civilians, the community becomes a permanent haven for crime, but if the civilians rid their community of the Mafia, they win.

## THE OBJECTIVE
Simply put, the objective of the game is for the mafia to “kill off” citizens until they are the majority or the civilians to kill off the entire mafia. When one of those two things happens, the game is over.

For the sake of example, let’s say you have a group of 13 people. Roles must be assigned to each person in secret.

The players are divided into two teams of **Mafias and Civilians**. The Mafia team will include 3 players: one god father, one simple mafia, and one terror.
The civilian team will be formed by 1 doctor, 1 sniper, 1 detective, 1 

There will be 3 mafias (1 god father,1 terror, 1 simple mafia), 1 detective, 1 doctor, 1 narrator, and 8 civilians. Great, now everyone has a role. 

Be sure they are all kept under wraps. Do not tell anyone your identity. The game itself is divided into two phases: Day and Night. During the night, everyone keeps his or her eyes closed until the narrator awakens each role beginning with the mafia, then the doctor, then the detective. But who are each of these roles and what do they do? So glad you asked.

Here is a quick tutorial about the game: [How to play mafia: animated - YouTube][HTPMAY]
## Rules
In general, you can lie and say pretty much whatever you want during a game of Mafia. However, there are some ground rules:

1. The roles are randomly assigned by god with going to [Mafia Forum Administration - Nerd Network][MFANN]
   Here are all the roles to be copy&pasted there
   ```
   Mafia - Don
   Mafia - Simple Mafia
   Mafia - Terror
   Civilian - Doctor
   Civilian - Detective
   Civilian - Sniper
   Civilian - Armor
   Civilian - Simple Citizen
   ```   
   We have 7 effective roles and depending on the number of players we have the number of Simple Citizens (ex: with 13 ppl we should have 6 (13-7) simple citizens)
1. No one is allowed to talk more than the time which is dedicated to him/her and god shall be able to mute people
1. Opening your eyes(/turning your webcam on) when it is not permitted is cheating.
2. Texting other players in private/public chat is cheating. Only the Mafia team can chat privately together.
## Roles:
1. **StoryTeller**: (/God of the game/the mayor/Judge)
   Is the moderator of the whole game play and anonunces turns. He/she knows everybody's rules and has the right to silence the group or restart the game completely.
1. **Mafia Team**:
   The Mafia-Team kill other players and try to convince other players who the mafia is without revealing themselves.
   1. **Godfather**: (/Mafia Don)
   2. **Terror**: If citizens vote to eleminate the terror during the day. The terror can take one of the players with himslef out of the game and the player will be assumed dead. However if the sniper kills terror during the night he will be elemniated without being able to kill other citizen.
   3. **Simple Mafia**: Is part of the mafia team but doesn't have any special ability.
1. **Citizen Team**:
   1. **The Doctor**: (/Medic/Bodyguard)
      Doctor can save himself (look under "Circumstances") and can save others. One of the roles that doctor should try to save is the Detective. Since he is the one which might announce his role early in the game and once revealed it's important to save him.
   2. **The Sniper**: 
      Depending on the number of bullets that god has given to him, the sniper can kill someone during the night. It's possible to not kill anyone during night if the sniper is unsure of who is the Mafia. One of the best targets to be eleminated by sniper is the Terror from the Mafia team.
   4. **The Detective**:  (/sheriff)
      Points at any other player and the StoryTeller can either nod or shake his head if the person is mafia or not; uses his or her power to sway public opinion.
      **Important:** The query of Mafia's Don is always negative so a negative result of player not necessary means that he is not part of the Mafia group.
   1. **The Armor**:  (/Bulletproof)
      This player cannot be killed by Mafia and only be voted off. The imporance of this role is since it cannot be killed by Mafia, it can be claimed by the owner and might be helpful in guiding citizens to find the Mafia team.
   5. **Simple Citizen**: (/Civilian)
      Citizens are the most basic role, who votes and tries to figure out the mafias and vote them off

**IMPORTANT**: In real life, the dead can not speak. Common saying of course. So in the game, the dead are not allowed to influence the town through speech or physical gestures. It is cheating. (They can talk, but any hinting at a mafia should get them kicked from the next round or game.)
