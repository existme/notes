# Mafia
![image.png](/img/games/godfather.png)
## Rules
In general, you can lie and say pretty much whatever you want during a game of Mafia. However, there are some ground rules:

1. Opening your eyes(/turning your webcam on) when it is not permitted is cheating.
2. Texting other players in private/public chat is cheating. Only the Mafia team can chat privately together.
## Roles:
1. **StoryTeller**: (/God of the game/the mayor)
   Is in charge of the whole game play and anonunces turns. He/she knows everybody's rules and has the right to silence the group or restart the game completely.
3. **Mafia Team**:
   The Mafia-Team kill other players and try to convince other players who the mafia is without revealing themselves.
   1. **Godfather**: (/Mafia Don)
   2. **Terror**: If citizens vote to eleminate the terror during the day. The terror can take one of the players with himslef out of the game and the player will be assumed dead. However if the sniper kills terror during the night he will be elemniated without being able to kill other citizen.
   3. **Simple Mafia**: Is part of the mafia team but doesn't have any special ability.
4. **Citizen Team**:
   1. **Doctor**: 
      Doctor can save himself (look under "Circumstances") and can save others
   2. **Sniper**: Depending on the number of bullets, the sniper can kill someone during the night.
   3. **Detective**:  (/sheriff)
      Points at any other player and the StoryTeller can either nod or shake his head if the person is mafia or not; uses his or her power to sway public opinion.
   5. **Simple Citizen**: (/Civilian)
      Citizens are the most basic role, who votes and tries to figure out the mafias and vote them off

**IMPORTANT**: In real life, the dead can not speak. Common saying of course. So in the game, the dead are not allowed to influence the town through speech or physical gestures. It is cheating. (They can talk, but any hinting at a mafia should get them kicked from the next round or game.)
