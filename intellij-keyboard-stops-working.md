# Intellij Keyboard Stops Working

----------------------------------------- 
The solution when keyboard got stuck is to restart the IBUS, by clicking the
keyboard icon in upper-right corner -> restart. This temporarily fixes the 
issue. If you don't want IBUS (you don't use languages other than English, ) 
remove it [1][source].
