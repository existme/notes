# Config-Calibre-Mail.Md

----------------------------------------- 

Launch Calibre, then click on the “Preferences” icon that looks like gears 
meshing in the top right of the menu bar. Go down to the fourth row and click 
on the first icon, which will look like an envelope and say “Sharing books by email.” 

```
