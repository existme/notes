## X11

There are two ways of entering unicode characters in X11

1. Hold Ctrl+⇧ Shift and type u followed by the hex digits. Then release Ctrl+⇧ Shift.
2. Enter Ctrl+⇧ Shift+u, release, then type the hex digits, and press ↵ Enter (or Space or even on some systems, press and release ⇧ Shift or Ctrl ).

## Vim

In the Vim editor, in insert mode, the user first types Ctrl+V u, then types in
the hexadecimal number of the symbol or character desired, and it will be
converted into the symbol.
