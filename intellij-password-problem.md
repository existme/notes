# Intellij Password Problem

----------------------------------------- 
If you do not want to type each time your master password, you can change it to empty password.
For this go to Settings / Appearance & Behaviour / System Settings / Passwords and press "Master Password" button.
At opened dialog change your cirrent master password to empty one.

```bash
Settings ->  Appearance & Behaviour -> System Settings -> Passwords
```

Incase for some reason passwords are not saved in keychain, use `In KeePass` option.

The settings would be stored in: `~/.IntelliJIdea2017.2/config/c.kdbx`.  
It will not be synced in `settings repository`.
